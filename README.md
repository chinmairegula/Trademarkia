# Trademarkia
AI Engineer Task: Class Recommendation System (K-Nearest Neighbour)

the creation of an AI model that will make categorization suggestions for trademarks based on the entered goods and services. The code use the USPTO ID Handbook dataset and provides a REST API for compatibility with the Flask framework.


Both GET and POST requests may now be handled by the /recommend route. While POST queries cause the class proposal to be created based on the given information about the products and services, GET requests return recommendations.

Remember to use python trademarkia-recommendation.py to launch the programme after storing the code in a Python file. You may try making a POST request to http://localhost:5000/algorithm after the Flask server is up and running.
